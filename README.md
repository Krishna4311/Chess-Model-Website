## Step 1: Download the Files

Download the following files:
- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the structure of the chessboard.
- `style.css`: The CSS file containing the styling for the chessboard and pieces.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing functionality for controlling the chessboard.

## Step 2: Add Files to Your Project

Place the downloaded files in your project directory.

## Step 3: Include the Files in Your HTML

In your HTML file (`index.html`), include the CSS and JavaScript files using the `<link>` and `<script>` tags, respectively.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

## Step 4: Set Up the HTML Structure

Ensure your HTML file contains the necessary structure for the chessboard and controls. You can copy the structure from the provided `index.html` file.

## Step 5: Customize the Chessboard

Open the `style.css` file to customize the appearance of the chessboard, pieces, and controls. You can modify colors, sizes, animations, and other visual aspects to suit your preferences.

## Step 6: Customize the Chessboard Controls

In the `script.js` file, you can customize the behavior of the chessboard controls. This includes functionalities such as toggling animations, showing/hiding board borders, and enabling/disabling body scrolling.

## Step 7: Test and Deploy

Test your 3D chessboard locally by opening the HTML file in a web browser. Ensure all functionalities work as expected. Once satisfied, deploy your project to a web server to share it with others.
